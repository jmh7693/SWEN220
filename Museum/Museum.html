    <h2>SWEN-220 &nbsp;Alloy Exam<br></h2><h2>Museum Model</h2>
    
    
    <p>You are to complete the model of a simple museum that loans some of its collection (at a
      hefty price) to individual and corporate clients. The model uses the
      predefined signatures and relations in the file <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="Museum.als"><em>Museum.als</em></a></p>
    <p>The signatures, relations are documented, as are the facts, predicates
      and assertions you are to complete. If you have any questions about
      interpreting what is required, ask your instructor.</p>
    <p>You are <strong style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">NOT</strong> to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add or modify any signatures or relations (fields),</li>
      <li>Add any of your own facts, predicates, or assertions.</li>
      <li>Edit anything other than the bodies of facts, predicates and
        assertions that are <em style="text-decoration: underline;">clearly</em>
        marked as being your responsibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Brief Model Description</h3>
    <p>The signatures in the model are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><span>Picture</span></small>
        </strong>- pictures in the museum's collection.</li>
      <li><small><strong style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Client
          </strong></small>- individuals and corporations that can have pictures
        on loaned, and can express the desire for other pictures.</li>
      <li>The one and only <small><strong style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Museum</strong></small>,
        that tracks all the pictures on display, including some in the permanent
        collection that can never be loaned.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The facts are designed to ensure a consistent state, which means (among
      other things):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pictures in the permanent collection are always on display.</li>
      <li>All pictures are either on display or on loan to a client; no picture
        can be simultaneously on display and on loan.</li>
      <li>No two clients can have the same picture loaned to them.</li>
      <li>If a client desires a picture, it must be on loan (otherwise the
        museum could loan the picture immediately to the client).</li>
      <li>No client can desire a picture that the client already has on loan.</li>
    </ul><h3>Grading &amp; Submission</h3>Submit
your solution (Museum.als) to the Alloy Exam dropbox. Submit as many
times as you like, last version before the dropbox due date will be
graded. <br><br>The&nbsp;exam is worth 35 points. Each correct fact = 5 points. Partial credit for incorrect facts may be awarded. <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do Not submit a model with syntax errors!</span> Comment out the offending expression and insure the model checker executes.
